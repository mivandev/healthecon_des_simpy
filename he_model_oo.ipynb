    "A very simple model to serve as an exploration of creating health economic Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) models in Python using SimPy library. The clinical context of the model is as follows:\n",
    "* During a cycle of treatment, patients can either die (p = 0.2) or experience a full cycle of treatment without any other events occurring.\n",
    "* Patients can receive up to five cycles of treatment.\n",
    "* A full cycle causes a longer delay or timeout compared to dying during a cycle. These timeouts are assumed to generated by a exponential data generating process.\n",
    "* After surviving the maximum number of treatment cycles, patients will enter a follow up phase, in which patients can also die.\n",
    "\n",
    "The health economic context is as follows:\n",
    "* Each cycle of treatment incurs 5000 euro initially and 250 euro per day.\n",
    "* Followup costs 3500 euro per patient as a lumpsum.\n",
    "* Health-related quality of life (QoL) in the treatment phase is 0.7 as expressed over the duration of one year.\n",
    "* QoL in the followup phase is 0.8 as expressed over the duration of one year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, all patients are simulated at t = 0, so the interarrival time = 0. Note that the model currently only represents one comparator. So for an actual cost-effectiveness analysis, another comparator must be added, but this is very straightforward."
